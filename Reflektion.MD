## Kapitel 2
- getmetadata changed to extract meta data

- getTitles => extractTitles and helement to headerELement

- get lists to extractlist

## Kapitel 3 Functions
dont repeat yourself 
- changed getmetadata to simpler less repetitive function
- shorter now too
- considered turning it into smaller helper funcitons but it would have made it more confusing espcially with names 

extractParagraph
- made it shorter by variables in same line for push

extractlistdetails
- helper function for li which makes function shorter and focuses main elemnts into extractlist, because it is so long

## Kapitel 4

comments 
- workon making functions so clear that perhaps we dont need comments or docs for extract list or titles
